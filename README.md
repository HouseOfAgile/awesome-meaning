Font awesome general meaning relation between icons and meanings

This repository is mainly used to find some inspiration when searching for the right icon for an action. When looking for a standard icon over all the existing icon set, having a look to [Glyph Search](http://glyphsearch.com/) could make sense

## General actions
### Help box
Suppose you want to have a help box, you could `fa fa-info-circle-o` or a combinaison of `fa fa-info` + `fa-square-o`
```
<i class="fa fa-info-circle></i>

```

```
<span class="fa-stack fa-lg">
  <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-info fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
</span>
```

###Partner Account or Company account

Depending on type of business you can use some of 

For a school institution `fa-graduation-cap` could makes sense or `fa-university`

For a standard institution (ngo, association) use `fa-institution`

For a another type of company, `fa-building` could makes sense

## Standard Actions
